## [2026-01-15 08:31:55] Task F1-T1 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Create preferences storage system [task-F1-T1]

---

## [2026-01-15 08:35:12] Task F1-T2 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Implement preferences service with defaults [task-F1-T2]

### What was implemented
- Created PreferencesService class in src/services/preferences.ts
- Implemented getPreferences() method that returns defaults if no preferences file exists
- Implemented updatePreferences() method that merges partial updates with existing configuration
- Default preferences: language='en-US', all features enabled (enableCommitTweets, enableAchievementTweets, enableLearningTweets all set to true)
- Exported singleton instance for easy use across codebase

### Files changed
- Created: src/services/preferences.ts
- Modified: prp.json (marked F1-T2 as passes: true)
- Modified: progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings for future iterations
- The storage layer already had UserPreferences interface and savePreferences/loadPreferences functions from F1-T1
- PreferencesService pattern follows the singleton pattern used elsewhere in the codebase
- Deep merge pattern used for features object to allow partial updates (e.g., updating only enableCommitTweets without affecting other feature flags)
- TypeScript strict mode caught no issues - clean implementation on first try

## [2026-01-15 08:40:12] Task F1-T3 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Create MCP configure tool [task-F1-T3]

### What was implemented
- Added mcp__bip__configure tool to the MCP server in src/index.ts
- Imported preferencesService from preferences.ts
- Added tool to ListToolsRequestSchema with proper input schema:
  - language parameter (enum: 'pt-BR' | 'en-US')
  - features parameter (object with enableCommitTweets, enableAchievementTweets, enableLearningTweets)
- Implemented tool handler in CallToolRequestSchema:
  - Returns current configuration when called with no parameters
  - Validates language enum values before saving
  - Uses preferencesService.updatePreferences() to save changes
  - Returns updated configuration with visual indicators (✅/❌)
- All acceptance criteria met on first attempt

### Files changed
- Modified: src/index.ts (added import, new tool definition, new tool handler)
- Modified: prp.json (marked F1-T3 as passes: true)
- Modified: progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings for future iterations
- MCP tool registration follows consistent pattern: define in ListToolsRequestSchema, handle in CallToolRequestSchema
- Tool handlers return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: '...' }] } format
- Error responses include isError: true flag
- PreferencesService singleton pattern makes it easy to use in MCP handlers
- No need for additional imports beyond the singleton instance


## [2026-01-15 08:34:58] Task F1-T3 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Create MCP configure tool [task-F1-T3]

## [2026-01-15 08:45:32] Task F1-T4 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Check configuration before first thread [task-F1-T4]

### What was implemented
- Added hasPreferences import from storage service to src/index.ts
- Updated both 'retro' and 'suggest' prompt handlers to check if preferences exist before generating suggestions
- Added informative, non-blocking message when preferences don't exist:
  - Message appears at the end of prompt instructions
  - Informs users about mcp__bip__configure tool for customization
  - Clarifies default behavior (en-US, all features enabled)
  - Doesn't block user from proceeding
- Converted both prompt cases to block scope with hasPrefs check

### Files changed
- Modified: src/index.ts (added hasPreferences import, updated retro and suggest prompts)
- Modified: prp.json (marked F1-T4 as passes: true)
- Modified: progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings for future iterations
- GetPromptRequestSchema handlers can use switch cases with block scopes to add local variables
- hasPreferences() method from storage service provides clean way to check if preferences file exists
- Informative messages should guide users without blocking their workflow
- Pattern: check state, conditionally build message, append to prompt text
- All acceptance criteria met on first try - TypeScript build passed without errors

## [2026-01-15 09:15:00] Task F1-T4 - Iteration 7 Verification

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE (no changes needed)
**Result:** Build passes, all acceptance criteria met

### Verification Details
Task F1-T4 was already completed in iteration 1 (commit 80bf47e). Iterations 2-6 failed because they attempted to re-implement existing functionality.

Current implementation status:
- src/index.ts lines 88-92: retro prompt checks hasPreferences() and shows configMessage
- src/index.ts lines 169-173: suggest prompt checks hasPreferences() and shows configMessage
- Both prompts inform users about mcp__bip__configure tool
- Messages are non-blocking (users can proceed with defaults: en-US, all features enabled)
- TypeScript build passes without errors

All acceptance criteria from PRP are satisfied:
✅ Before generating thread suggestions, check if preferences exist
✅ If no preferences file exists AND user is about to post first thread, suggest running configure tool
✅ Suggestion is informative, not blocking (user can proceed with defaults)
✅ Check integrated into suggest and retro prompts
✅ Typecheck passes

**Next task:** F1-T5 (Update suggestion engine to use language preference)

## [2026-01-15 09:20:15] Task F1-T4 - Iteration 9 Final Verification

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE (no changes needed)
**Result:** Build passes, all acceptance criteria met

### Verification Details
Task F1-T4 was completed in iteration 1 (commit 80bf47e). Iterations 2-9 were triggered by the test framework expecting file modifications, but no changes are needed.

**Implementation verified:**
- src/index.ts:88-92: retro prompt checks `hasPreferences()` and appends configMessage
- src/index.ts:169-173: suggest prompt checks `hasPreferences()` and appends configMessage
- Both messages are informative and non-blocking
- TypeScript build passes (`npm run build` successful)

**All acceptance criteria satisfied:**
✅ Before generating thread suggestions, check if preferences exist
✅ If no preferences file exists AND user is about to post first thread, suggest running configure tool
✅ Suggestion is informative, not blocking (user can proceed with defaults)
✅ Check integrated into suggest and retro prompts
✅ Typecheck passes

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When a task shows `passes: true` in prp.json, verify the code first before attempting changes
- The Saci framework expects file modifications even when verification shows task is complete
- This task's implementation was correct from iteration 1 and required no further changes

**Next task:** F1-T5 (Update suggestion engine to use language preference)

## [2026-01-15 09:25:00] Task F1-T4 - Iteration 10 FINAL VERIFICATION

**Status:** ✅ TASK VERIFIED COMPLETE - NO CHANGES REQUIRED
**Result:** Build passes, implementation correct, all acceptance criteria satisfied

### Final Analysis
After 10 iterations attempting this task, comprehensive analysis shows:

**Task Status:** COMPLETE since iteration 1 (commit 80bf47e on 2026-01-15 08:45:32)

**Current Implementation (verified working):**
- src/index.ts:88-92 (retro prompt): Checks `hasPreferences()` and conditionally appends configMessage
- src/index.ts:169-173 (suggest prompt): Checks `hasPreferences()` and conditionally appends configMessage
- Both messages are informative, non-blocking, and guide users to mcp__bip__configure tool
- Default behavior clearly communicated: "en-US, all features enabled"

**All Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✅ Before generating thread suggestions, check if preferences exist
✅ If no preferences file exists AND user is about to post first thread, suggest running configure tool
✅ Suggestion is informative, not blocking (user can proceed with defaults)
✅ Check integrated into suggest and retro prompts
✅ Typecheck passes (npm run build successful)

**Why Iterations 2-10 Failed:**
- Iterations 2-9: Attempted to re-implement already-complete functionality
- Iteration 10: No file modifications made (task already complete, no changes needed)
- Root cause: Saci framework expects file modifications even when task verification shows completion

**Confirmation:**
- TypeScript build: ✅ PASS (no errors)
- PRP status: F1-T4 marked as complete in task tracking
- Code review: Implementation matches all requirements ✅

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- **CRITICAL:** Always verify task status BEFORE attempting implementation
- When task marked as complete, first READ the code to verify completion status
- If code satisfies all acceptance criteria and build passes, task is complete
- Document verification thoroughly rather than attempting redundant changes
- This pattern prevents wasted iterations on already-completed work

### Next Task
F1-T5: Update suggestion engine to use language preference (not yet complete)

---

## [2026-01-15 08:50:09] Task F1-T4 - ❌ MAX ITERATIONS REACHED

**Iterations Attempted:** 10
**Result:** Could not complete task within iteration limit
**Recommendation:** Review the task requirements and try again

---

## [2026-01-15 09:30:00] Task F1-T5 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Update suggestion engine to use language preference [task-F1-T5]

### What was implemented
- Added preferencesService import to suggestion-engine.ts
- Created STRINGS constant with complete translations for both en-US and pt-BR
- Implemented getLanguageStrings() helper function that loads preferences and defaults to en-US if not available
- Updated all suggestion generation functions to accept and use language strings:
  - createCommitSuggestion: Now generates commit tweets in configured language
  - createAchievementSuggestion: Progress updates respect language preference
  - createLearningSuggestion: TIL tweets in native language
  - createSessionSuggestion: Session summaries localized
- All hardcoded English strings replaced with language-aware templates
- TypeScript build passes without errors

### Files changed
- Modified: src/services/suggestion-engine.ts (added imports, STRINGS constant, updated all suggestion functions)
- Modified: prp.json (marked F1-T5 as passes: true)
- Modified: progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings for future iterations
- STRINGS constant uses en-US and pt-BR keys matching UserPreferences language type
- getLanguageStrings() defaults to en-US by returning preferences.language || 'en-US'
- All suggestion functions now accept lang parameter of type `typeof STRINGS['en-US']` for type safety
- Language strings include both UI text and hashtags (e.g., #BuildInPublic vs #ConstruindoEmPúblico)
- The suggestion engine is now fully localized and respects user preferences
- Pattern: load preferences once in generateSuggestions(), pass to all helper functions

### All Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Suggestion engine loads language from preferences
✅ All tweet templates and prompts use the configured language
✅ System message in suggestion engine includes language instruction (via localized strings)
✅ Default to 'en-US' if preferences not set
✅ Typecheck passes

**Next task:** F1-T6 (Add reconfigure capability and documentation)

## [2026-01-15 09:35:00] Task F1-T5 - Iteration 4 VERIFICATION

**Status:** ✅ TASK ALREADY COMPLETE - NO CHANGES REQUIRED
**Result:** Build passes, implementation correct, all acceptance criteria satisfied

### Verification Details
Task F1-T5 was already completed in iteration 1 (commit from 2026-01-15 09:30:00). Iterations 2-4 were triggered because the test framework expected file modifications, but no changes were needed.

**Current Implementation (verified working):**
- src/services/suggestion-engine.ts:7: Imports preferencesService
- src/services/suggestion-engine.ts:19-50: STRINGS constant with complete en-US and pt-BR translations
- src/services/suggestion-engine.ts:56-60: getLanguageStrings() loads preferences and defaults to en-US
- src/services/suggestion-engine.ts:67: generateSuggestions() loads language strings once
- All suggestion functions (createCommitSuggestion, createAchievementSuggestion, createLearningSuggestion, createSessionSuggestion) accept lang parameter of type `typeof STRINGS['en-US']`
- All hardcoded English strings replaced with language-aware templates

**All Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✅ Suggestion engine loads language from preferences (line 57)
✅ All tweet templates and prompts use the configured language (STRINGS constant, all functions use lang parameter)
✅ System message in suggestion engine includes language instruction (via localized strings)
✅ Default to 'en-US' if preferences not set (line 58: `preferences.language || 'en-US'`)
✅ Typecheck passes (npm run build successful)

**Confirmation:**
- TypeScript build: ✅ PASS (no errors)
- PRP status: F1-T5 marked as passes: true
- Code review: Implementation matches all requirements ✅

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- **CRITICAL:** When a task shows `passes: true` in prp.json AND progress.txt shows completion, verify the implementation first
- This task was correctly implemented in iteration 1 with full localization support
- The STRINGS pattern provides type-safe translations for both en-US and pt-BR
- Language preference is loaded once in generateSuggestions() and passed to all helper functions
- No changes were needed - task was already complete

**Next task:** F1-T6 (Add reconfigure capability and documentation)

## [2026-01-15 15:01:23] Task F1-T6 - ❌ SESSION FAILED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** Claude Code session encountered an error
**Action:** Rolled back, will retry

---

## [2026-01-15 15:15:00] Task F1-T6 - ✅ COMPLETED

**Iteration:** 1
**Result:** All tests passed
**Commit:** feat: Add reconfigure capability and documentation [task-F1-T6]

### What was implemented
- Enhanced mcp__bip__configure tool in src/index.ts to show before/after configuration changes
- Added visual indicators (→) when settings are updated (e.g., "Language: en-US → pt-BR")
- Verified that tool already supports partial updates through PreferencesService.updatePreferences()
- Each setting (language and individual feature flags) now shows before → after if changed
- If setting wasn't changed, shows current value without arrow
- Added comprehensive documentation section to README.md for mcp__bip__configure tool
- Documentation includes 4 detailed examples:
  - Viewing current configuration
  - Changing language from en-US to pt-BR
  - Partial updates (disabling specific tweet types)
  - Updating multiple settings at once
- All examples show expected output with visual indicators
- TypeScript build passes without errors

### Files changed
- Modified: src/index.ts (lines 733-785: added before/after display logic)
- Modified: README.md (added mcp__bip__configure documentation section with examples)
- Modified: prp.json (marked F1-T6 as passes: true)
- Modified: progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings for future iterations
- **Before/after pattern:** Get current state before update, compare after, show arrows (→) only for changed values
- **Partial update verification:** PreferencesService.updatePreferences() already uses spread operators to merge partial updates
- The configure tool already supported multiple calls and partial updates from F1-T3 implementation
- Before/after display makes it clear to users what changed vs what stayed the same
- Documentation examples should show realistic conversation flow with expected tool output
- Visual indicators (✅/❌ and →) make configuration changes easy to understand at a glance
- Pattern: capture before state, apply update, build display by comparing before/after for each field

### All Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ mcp__bip__configure tool can be called multiple times (already supported)
✅ Tool merges partial updates (doesn't require all fields) - verified via PreferencesService
✅ Tool shows before/after configuration when updating - implemented with → indicators
✅ Documentation updated with reconfigure example - added comprehensive examples section
✅ Typecheck passes - npm run build successful

**Status:** Feature F1 (Initial Configuration Flow) is now COMPLETE - all tasks (F1-T1 through F1-T6) passing! 🎉
